## Sell me on it

What if you could have _infinite scrolling_ fields of beans to plant, cultivate
and maintain, all from within your browser? 

Now, to be realistic, these beans take 55 days or so to mature, but no worry,
Bean Farming Simulator 2025 includes a handy feature to set a calendar reminder
if you so desire to help you remember to reap your beans.

## FAQ

### Isn't that actually a corn plant?

Nope, they're beans because that's the name of the game

### Why can I sell beans for money? What is money for?

What *is* money for indeed.
